description: "I used to think that learning to code was everything that I needed
  to achieve. But after some time I realized that I need to work on many other
  stuff. The thing is, what I used to dream of last year, I now have, and now I
  see, that I need much more and what are the cons of this situation right now.
  I need to work on myself, and I will work really hard, and hopefully that will
  lead me somewhere in the future. "
